# aabb_tree

[AABB-TREE](https://github.com/dengwirda/aabb-tree) provides d-dimensional axis-aligned bounding-box (AABB) tree construction and search for collections of spatial objects — useful for efficient spatial queries such as intersection tests between collections of objects.

## Install

```matlab
mip install --channel mip-org/dev aabb_tree
mip load aabb_tree
```

Usage:

```matlab
boxes = [xmin ymin xmax ymax];   % one row per object
tr = maketree(boxes);            % build the AABB-tree
[qi, qp, qj] = queryset(tr, ...) % spatial queries
```

This package is the spatial-query base used by several other dengwirda toolboxes in this channel (`find_tria`, `find_poly`, `mesh2d`), which declare it as a dependency.

## Architecture

Pure MATLAB — a single `[any]` build, no compiled code.

## Tests

`test_aabb_tree_channel.m` builds an AABB-tree over a random collection of boxes and verifies the tree's defining properties: each object is contained in exactly one node, and every node encloses the objects it holds.

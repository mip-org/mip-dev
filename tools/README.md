# mip-channel-tools

Build, index, and release tooling shared by MIP package channels. A channel's
GitHub Actions workflows call this package to prepare package sources, run
per-OS setup, upload bundled `.mhl` artifacts to GitHub Releases, assemble the
channel index, and parse issue-driven build requests.

This currently lives inside the `mip-dev` channel repo under `tools/`. It is
self-contained (`pyproject.toml` + `src/`) so it can be lifted out to its own
repository and published to PyPI, after which channels would depend on it via
`pip install mip-channel-tools` instead of an in-repo path.

## Install

In CI (and for a non-editable local install):

```bash
python -m pip install ./tools
```

For local development against the source:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ./tools
```

## Usage

A single CLI with subcommands, exposed both as the `mip-channel` console
script and as a runnable module. Workflows use the module form
(`python -m mip_channel_tools ...`) because it avoids console-script PATH and
shebang issues in the Linux build container; locally either works:

```bash
mip-channel --help
python -m mip_channel_tools --help

mip-channel prepare --package-path packages/<name>/<release> --architecture <arch>
mip-channel package-setup --architecture <arch>
mip-channel upload [--mhl build/bundled/<file>.mhl]
mip-channel assemble-index [--repo-root .]
mip-channel build-request validate --output-file <path> [--title-file <path>]
mip-channel build-request apply --dispatch-file <path> [--errors-file <path>]
mip-channel affected --changed-files <path> --dispatch-file <path>
mip-channel scheduled-check --dispatch-file <path> [--summary-file <path>]
```

Commands that read the channel tree (`assemble-index`, `affected`,
`scheduled-check`, `build-request`) take `--repo-root` (default: the current
directory), so they must be run from, or pointed at, the channel checkout.

# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed `push-build.yml` failing with `fatal: bad object <BEFORE>` on any push
  carrying more than one new commit: the changed-files diff needs the push's
  BEFORE commit, but `fetch-depth: 2` only reached AFTER's immediate parent.
  Checkout now uses `fetch-depth: 0` (full history).
- Windows strip step now renames toolchain directories (`Move-Item` to
  `*.deleted`) instead of running the slow VS uninstaller and
  `Remove-Item -Recurse` over million-file trees. An NTFS same-volume rename is
  metadata-only, cutting the step from ~4 min to seconds. Mirrors the macOS
  strip step; the runner is ephemeral so leaving bytes on disk is fine. Added a
  "Verify strip (Windows)" gate (mirrors Linux) that fails the job if a
  compiler/linker still resolves under a stripped root, so a silently-failed
  rename can't let a non-self-contained package pass. The gate matches on
  resolved path (not bare name) so benign collisions — e.g. Git for Windows'
  GNU coreutils `link.exe` — don't trip it.
- Upgraded all GitHub Actions to Node 24-native major versions (`checkout@v5`,
  `setup-python@v6`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`,
  `upload-pages-artifact@v5`, `deploy-pages@v5`, `matlab-actions/*@v3`) and
  dropped the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` workaround, which only
  forced the runtime without silencing the Node 20 deprecation warning.
- Stop bundling `libgfortran.so.5` in Linux MEX bundles: MATLAB ships it and
  resolves it via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so the bundled copy was dead weight.
  `libgomp.so.1` is still bundled (MATLAB does not ship it). See
  `notes/MEX-RUNTIME-LIBS.md`.
- Added `fmmlib2d` 1.2.4 (Greengard & Gimbutas' Laplace/Helmholtz FMM in
  R^2), built with OpenMP for `linux_x86_64`, `macos_arm64`, and
  `windows_x86_64`.
- Build-request issues now use `<name>@<release> <arch>` syntax in the body
  instead of `packages/<name>/<version> <arch>`.
- `all` now expands only to the architectures declared in the package's
  `mip.yaml`; packages without a channel-side `mip.yaml` no longer dispatch
  every architecture.
- Build-request issues now close automatically after all build jobs are
  successfully dispatched.
